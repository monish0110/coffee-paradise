    <p id="latte-text1" style="padding-top: 50px;">The iconic latte is loved in coffee shops all over the world. The subtle coffee taste 
        and creamy texture makes it a coffee thatâ€™s universally cherished by even the most casual of coffee drinkers.

    <p id="latte-text1">
        A latte is a coffee drink that originated in Italy and is made with espresso, steamed milk, and a thin layer of
        frothed milk on top. The drink is usually served in a glass and has a smooth texture and a balanced milky flavor.

        <b>Ingredients:</b>
        A latte is typically made with one or two shots of espresso, which is about one-third of the drink, and two-thirds steamed milk. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Texture:</b>
        The texture of a latte is important and gives the drink its appearance. The milk is steamed to create fine bubbles, or microfoam, which can be poured to create patterns in the drink. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sweeteners:</b>
        In the United States, lattes are often sweetened with refined white sugar, artificial sweeteners, or agave syrup. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Variations:</b>
        You can also make lattes with other ingredients besides espresso, such as rooibos or chai. For example, a matcha latte is made with matcha green tea.
